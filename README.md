# London_subjective-well-being_model

Reasearch aim: According to spatial dialectics (Soja 1980), there is an interactive relationship between urban space and human perception. The investigation aims to explore: What urban spatial characteristics can influence the subjective well-being (SWB) in London? Therefore, the hypothesis is that favorable urban spatial characteristics, such as green spaces and transportation accessibility, are significantly positively correlated with SWB. Conversely, negative features such as crime rates and obesity rates are significantly negatively correlated with SWB.
